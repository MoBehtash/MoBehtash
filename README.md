<h2>:car: Vehicle Dynamics Projects: </h2> 
<!-- ======================================================== -->
These are some basic vehicle dynamics-related projects that I did in my free time. These codebases do NOT include any proprietary data or information. All the equations and data are from open-access sources and/or the vehicle dynamics literature. I have tried to reference the sources as much as I can and whenever possible for anyone interested.
